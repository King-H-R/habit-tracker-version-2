3. Type (yesno or measurable)
4. Target value and unit if measurable
5. Brief description
6. Best time of day to do it

Format your response as a JSON array of objects with these properties:
{
  "name": "habit name",
  "category": "category",
  "type": "yesno|measurable",
  "targetValue": number (if applicable),
  "unit": "unit" (if applicable),
  "description": "brief description",
